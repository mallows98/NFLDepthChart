===================

Assumptions:
- This project has an assumption that there are player, and football position entries that are stored somewhere in  a repository. 

Project layout:
- The solution are divided into 3 projects:
1. NFLDepthChart.Console - An interactive console that calls the DepthChartManagement
2. NFLDepthChart.Lib - Contains the main function on creating and managing depth charts
3. NFLDepthChart.Tests - Contains unit tests that can be run by using xUnit. To run the tests, you need to have a VS.NET runner for xUnit
	See https://xunit.net/ for more info


Out of scope:
- Does not allow any new players or football player positions


Glossary:
Positions - player's role, not ranking
